Overview
Negotiation is a strategic two-player game where each participant starts with a set of resources valued differently by each player. The objective is to negotiate trades that enhance the total value of your resources more than your opponent can. Players alternate turns to communicate and make trade offers, aiming to optimize their inventory's value while managing the opponent's resources.

Action Space
Format: Actions are strings representing the player's messages or trade actions.
Special Tokens:
[Offer]: To make a trade offer.
Format: [Offer: <your resources> -> <their resources>.
Example: [Offer: 2 Wheat, 1 Ore -> 3 Sheep]
[Accept]: To accept an incoming trade offer.
[Deny]: To deny an incoming trade offer.
Examples:
"I think we should collaborate on gathering more resources."
"[Offer: 1 Wood -> 2 Wheat]"
"That is not worth it for me. [Deny]. But how about this: [Offer: 2 Wood -> 5 Wheat]"
"Fantastic. [Accept]"
Notes:
Players can include additional text before or after the special tokens.
When responding to an offer, ensure your reply contains either [Accept] or [Deny] as appropriate.
